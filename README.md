# Island Optimizer Dalamud Plugin

Largely based off the documentation offered in [Leiton Grey's spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1R4UKA2zZ1MZ7sRUEBAi2Eh0NCVPbb1iQh8BjoQ_vVX4/htmlview?usp=sharing).

I'm currently working on reverse engineering workshop ranks and pouch item quantities but until then, I'm using it to automate filling in values on my copy of the above spreadsheet.

On Tuesday:
```
/islander popularity supply demand
```

On Wed-Fri:
```
/islander supply demand
```

Must open the `Review Supply & Demand` window at least once in order for the game to load in values for supply & demand shift.
